# Inspiration

At MovementForward, we regularly need to identify houses of worship, schools, or other organizations around our offices and events. We typically purchase a list service that provides hundreds of rows of data, but that is not always up to date and can cost hundreds of dollars for a small area. By leveraging Google's Places API, we are able to get up to 60 organizations, ordered by prominence, within a specificed radius of our point of interest. This is perfect for giving us a starting point for an invite list or research on a location. 

# Usage
